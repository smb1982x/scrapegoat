# Playwright Removal Refactoring - Work Log

This log tracks all changes made during the comprehensive refactoring to remove Playwright from the Scrapegoat codebase and consolidate on Crawl4AI as the sole content fetcher.

## [2025-11-09 00:00:00] - Project Started

**Status**: Starting Phase 1 - Type System Changes

**Branch**: addCrawl4AI

**Plan Reference**: /home/mp/Workspace/scrapegoat/CURRENT_PLAN.md

**Objective**: Remove Playwright dependency and consolidate on Crawl4AI following the 12-phase implementation plan.

## [2025-11-09 07:00:53] - Phase 1 Complete: Type System Changes

**Files Modified**:
1. `src/scraper/fetcher/types.ts`
   - Updated Crawl4AIOptions interface with complete options per Section 0 of plan:
     - Content Enhancement: enableScreenshot, screenshotMode (changed "full" to "fullpage"), enableMedia, enableLinks
     - Advanced Scraping: waitFor, waitForTimeout, customJs, cacheMode, headers
     - Added comprehensive JSDoc comments with default values
   - Removed 'browser' from FetcherType union type
   - Changed type from: `"auto" | "http" | "browser" | "crawl4ai" | "file"`
   - Changed type to: `"auto" | "http" | "crawl4ai" | "file"`

2. `src/scraper/types.ts`
   - Removed ScrapeMode enum (lines 6-10)
   - Removed scrapeMode field from ScraperOptions interface
   - Removed 'browser' from fetcher type in ScraperOptions
   - Added import for Crawl4AIOptions from "./fetcher/types"
   - Updated crawl4ai field to reference Crawl4AIOptions interface instead of inline type
   - Added clarifying JSDoc comments

**Verification**:
- Ran `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation catches expected errors
- Build correctly fails at HtmlPlaywrightMiddleware.ts trying to import removed ScrapeMode
- This confirms type changes are working as expected

**Next Steps**: Phase 2 - Core Fetcher Logic (update AutoDetectFetcher, delete BrowserFetcher)

**Commit Message**: `refactor(phase1): remove ScrapeMode enum and browser fetcher type, update Crawl4AI options`

     - Logs deprecation warning
     - Redirects to 'crawl4ai'
   - Updated challenge fallback in autoDetect():
     - Changed from browserFetcher.fetch() to crawl4aiFetcher.fetch()
     - Updated log message: "falling back to Crawl4AI"
   - Updated close() method to remove browserFetcher.close()
   - Removed 'browser' case from canFetcherHandleSource()
   - Removed 'browser' case from getExpectedProtocol()
