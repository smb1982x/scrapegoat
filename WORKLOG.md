# Playwright Removal Refactoring - Work Log

This log tracks all changes made during the comprehensive refactoring to remove Playwright from the Scrapegoat codebase and consolidate on Crawl4AI as the sole content fetcher.

## [2025-11-09 00:00:00] - Project Started

**Status**: Starting Phase 1 - Type System Changes

**Branch**: addCrawl4AI

**Plan Reference**: /home/mp/Workspace/scrapegoat/CURRENT_PLAN.md

**Objective**: Remove Playwright dependency and consolidate on Crawl4AI following the 12-phase implementation plan.

---

## [2025-11-09 07:00:53] - Phase 1 Complete: Type System Changes

**Files Modified**:
1. `src/scraper/fetcher/types.ts`
   - Updated Crawl4AIOptions interface with complete options per Section 0 of plan:
     - Content Enhancement: enableScreenshot, screenshotMode (changed "full" to "fullpage"), enableMedia, enableLinks
     - Advanced Scraping: waitFor, waitForTimeout, customJs, cacheMode, headers
     - Added comprehensive JSDoc comments with default values
   - Removed 'browser' from FetcherType union type
   - Changed type from: `"auto" | "http" | "browser" | "crawl4ai" | "file"`
   - Changed type to: `"auto" | "http" | "crawl4ai" | "file"`

2. `src/scraper/types.ts`
   - Removed ScrapeMode enum (lines 6-10)
   - Removed scrapeMode field from ScraperOptions interface
   - Removed 'browser' from fetcher type in ScraperOptions
   - Added import for Crawl4AIOptions from "./fetcher/types"
   - Updated crawl4ai field to reference Crawl4AIOptions interface instead of inline type
   - Added clarifying JSDoc comments

**Verification**:
- Ran `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation catches expected errors
- Build correctly fails at HtmlPlaywrightMiddleware.ts trying to import removed ScrapeMode
- This confirms type changes are working as expected

**Next Steps**: Phase 2 - Core Fetcher Logic (update AutoDetectFetcher, delete BrowserFetcher)

**Commit Message**: `refactor(phase1): remove ScrapeMode enum and browser fetcher type, update Crawl4AI options`

     - Logs deprecation warning
     - Redirects to 'crawl4ai'
   - Updated challenge fallback in autoDetect():
     - Changed from browserFetcher.fetch() to crawl4aiFetcher.fetch()
     - Updated log message: "falling back to Crawl4AI"
   - Updated close() method to remove browserFetcher.close()
   - Removed 'browser' case from canFetcherHandleSource()
   - Removed 'browser' case from getExpectedProtocol()
   - Updated JSDoc comments to reflect removal of browser fetcher

## [2025-11-09 07:07:23] - Phase 3 Complete: Pipeline Middleware

**Files Modified**:
1. `src/scraper/pipelines/HtmlPipeline.ts`
   - Removed HtmlPlaywrightMiddleware import
   - Removed playwrightMiddleware instance variable
   - Renamed standardMiddleware to middleware (now always used)
   - Removed conditional middleware stack logic:
     - Removed scrapeMode checks (options.scrapeMode === "playwright" || "auto")
     - Now always uses standard middleware stack
   - Removed close() method override
     - Previously called playwrightMiddleware.closeBrowser()
     - Now inherits base class close() (no-op)
   - Updated class JSDoc to document change from Playwright to Crawl4AI

2. `src/scraper/middleware/index.ts`
   - Removed HtmlPlaywrightMiddleware export

**Files Deleted**:
1. `src/scraper/middleware/HtmlPlaywrightMiddleware.ts` (831 lines removed)
   - Complex Playwright rendering logic removed
   - Shadow DOM extraction, iframe processing, frameset handling
   - Credential propagation

2. `src/scraper/middleware/HtmlPlaywrightMiddleware.test.ts` (~500 lines removed)
   - Test coverage for removed middleware

**Verification**: All Playwright middleware references removed from pipeline layer

**Next Steps**: Phase 4 - CLI and Utilities (remove ensurePlaywrightBrowsersInstalled, update entry points)

**Commit Message**: `refactor(phase3): remove HtmlPlaywrightMiddleware and simplify HtmlPipeline`

---

## [2025-11-09 07:15:00] - Phase 4 Complete: CLI and Utilities

**Files Modified**:
1. `src/cli/utils.ts`
   - Removed chromium import from playwright
   - Removed execSync import from node:child_process
   - Removed existsSync import from node:fs
   - Removed getProjectRoot import (no longer needed)
   - Deleted ensurePlaywrightBrowsersInstalled() function (lines 47-83)
     - Function handled automatic Playwright browser installation
     - Checked PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH environment variable
     - Attempted to install chromium browser if not found
     - No longer needed as Crawl4AI handles browser automation in Docker

2. `src/index.ts`
   - Removed ensurePlaywrightBrowsersInstalled import
   - Removed ensurePlaywrightBrowsersInstalled() call
   - Simplified entry point - no longer needs browser setup

3. `src/cli/commands/default.ts`
   - Removed ensurePlaywrightBrowsersInstalled from import list

4. `src/cli/commands/worker.ts`
   - Removed ensurePlaywrightBrowsersInstalled from import list
   - Removed ensurePlaywrightBrowsersInstalled() call (line 76)

**Verification**:
- Ran `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation
- Build correctly fails at GitHubRepoScraperStrategy.ts trying to import ScrapeMode (expected)
- All Playwright browser installation logic removed
- CLI entry points simplified

**Next Steps**: Phase 5 - Tool and Strategy Updates (update ScrapeTool, WebScraperStrategy, GitHubRepoScraperStrategy, etc.)

**Commit Message**: `refactor(phase4): remove Playwright browser installation utilities`
